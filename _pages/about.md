My name is Daniel Paradiso and I am a [second-year graduate student](https://artsandsciences.syracuse.edu/people/graduate-students/daniel-paradiso/) in the Department of Physics at Syracuse University working with [Dr. Eric Coughlin](https://ecoughli.expressions.syr.edu/). My research is focused on understanding the deaths of stars in our universe through both self-induced and external mechanisms.
