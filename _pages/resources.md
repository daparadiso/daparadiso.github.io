Here are some useful resources that I have encountered in my life in academia so far. I have found most, if not all, of them through others, so full credit goes to them for discovering these.

- **For students**
  - [GRE requirements and admission fees for US/Canadian Astronomy and Physics Programs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19UhYToXOPZkZ3CM469ru3Uwk4584CmzZyAVVwQJJcyc/edit#gid=0)
  - [Information about the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship (GRFP)](https://www.alexhunterlang.com/nsf-fellowship): the basics, some guidelines, and some examples of successful essays.
  - [Astrobites](https://astrobites.org): journal articles in a digestible format. You can also submit your own research!
  - [AstroSites](https://astrosites.github.io/index.html): contains a tutorial to build a website for yourself!

- **Visualizations**
  - [AstroAnimations](https://www.astroanimation.org)
  - [DSN Now](https://eyes.nasa.gov/dsn/dsn.html)
  - [Exoplanet Travel Bureau](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/alien-worlds/exoplanet-travel-bureau/)
  - [Gaia's Stellar Family Portrait](https://sci.esa.int/gaia-stellar-family-portrait/): explore the properties of over 1 billion stars in our Galaxy, and learn about how color-magnitude diagrams can be used to determine a star's position in its life cycle.
  - [NASA Eyes on Exoplanets](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/eyes-on-exoplanets/)
  - [NASA free ebooks](https://www.nasa.gov/connect/ebooks/index.html)
  - [NRAO's Cosmic Coloring Compositor](https://public.nrao.edu/color/): utilize the entire electromagnetic spectrum to make an awesome image of your favorite galaxy. 
  - [NRAO's Interferometry Explained](https://public.nrao.edu/interferometry-explained/): explore how the Very Large Array and ALMA gather data with their many antennae.
  - [NRAO's Milky Way Explorer](https://public.nrao.edu/explore/milky-way-explorer/): explore the Milky Way with NRAO astronomers.
  - [NRAO Mission Control](https://public.nrao.edu/explore/mission-control/): see what the Very Large Array and ALMA are observing right now!
  - [Our galactic neighborhood](https://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/our-galactic-neighborhood): a really beautiful interactive graphic for exploring some well-known local dwarf galaxies.
  - [Quantum made simple](https://toutestquantique.fr/en/): great visualizations of abstract quantum mechanics concepts and experiments.

- **Reading**
  - [The Technology of Radio Astronomy](https://public.nrao.edu/radio-astronomy/the-technology-of-radio-astronomy/)

- **Tools**
  - [Coblis (color blindness simulator)](https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/): useful for checking if figures in your papers or talks are able to be easily understood by those with low or no color vision.
  - [Implicit bias tests](https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html): learning about your own unconscious biases is the first step in changing them.
  - [Propagation of uncertainties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propagation_of_uncertainty#Example_formulae): I always always have to check this when propagating uncertainties.
