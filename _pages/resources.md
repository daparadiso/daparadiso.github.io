Here are some useful resources that I have found over the years, and I will continue to add to it as I go. I was first inspired and learned to make a personal website when I found a fellow PhD students website, which can be found [here](https://abulatek.github.io/).

- **For students**
  - [Astrobites](https://astrobites.org): This is the website I always suggest to people to learn about astrophysics research in a super fun and digestable way! 
  - [AstroSites](https://astrosites.github.io/index.html): This is the tutorial that I used to build my first website. It is very simple and a good place to start!
