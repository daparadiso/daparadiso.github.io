Here are some useful resources that I have found over the years, and I will continue to add to it as I go. I was first inspired and learned to make a personal website when I found a fellow PhD students website, which can be found [here](https://abulatek.github.io/).

- **For Research**
  - I use the app [Sim Daltonism](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sim-daltonism/id693112260?mt=12) (for Mac) to ensure that any of the plots I make for research are accessible to those with color vision deficiency.
  - An alternate option for checking that your color schemes are accessible is this online tool through [Adobe](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-accessibility).
  - I often get bored of my plotting schemes, so when I feel the need for inspiration I check out this [website](https://colorhunt.co) which has a plethora of color palettes.
  - I always start my work day by reading new papers on the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org) to get my brain working.
  - My number 1 tool for finding research papers (other than Google) is [NASA ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu). You can export citations for the paper, look at the references, citations, and so much more.

- **For Students**
  - [Astrobites](https://astrobites.org): This is the website I always suggest to people to learn about astrophysics research in a super fun and digestable way! 
  - [AstroSites](https://astrosites.github.io/index.html): This is the tutorial that I used to build my first website. It is very simple and a good place to start!
  - The [National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship (GRFP)](https://www.nsfgrfp.org) is a three year research fellowship for graduate students. Here is a [website](https://www.alexhunterlang.com/nsf-fellowship) that is full of information, tips, and previous applications, though it might be a bit outdated at this point.
  - [NASA FINESST](https://michaelradke.com/finesst/) is a 1-3 year research grant for graudate students in earth and space sciences. Here is a useful [website](https://michaelradke.com/posts/finesst-tips/) that is full of information, tips, and previous proposals. Note that, unlike the NSF GRFP, the FINESST proposal is submitted in collaboration with an advisor.
- [Logan Pearce](http://www.loganpearcescience.com/index.html) has possibly the most impressive [list of resources](http://www.loganpearcescience.com/resources.html) for astronomers and scientists at many career stages, including really great advice on writing applications. Definitely worth checking out!
