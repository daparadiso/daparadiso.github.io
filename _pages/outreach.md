Syracuse University Research in Physics (SURPh) Program
======
For the last three summers (2022-2024) I have been a mentor for a total of six Syracuse City School District high school students that participated in the SURPh program (now called SUPER-Tech SHIP) hosted by professors in the department of physics at Syracuse University. Each summer, two students worked together on a project studying the tidal disruption of stars by suppermassive black holes. I worked with the students on understanding the properties and evolution of stars using the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics ([MESA](https://docs.mesastar.org/en/release-r24.03.1/){:target="_blank"}) stellar evolution software and Mathematica for data analysis. The students then studied the rate at which stellar debris returned to the black hole once the star was tidally destroyed using a combination of analytical and computational (smoothed-particle hydrodynamics) methods. Recently, the projects from summer 2022 and 2023 culminated in a published [paper](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ad0388){:target="_blank"} in the Astrophysical Journal Letters with ALL FOUR SURPh STUDENTS!

During the program this summer I also organized and led a week-long computational bootcamp for all 24 students participating in the program where I introduced the students to computational tools that are crucial for conducting research, including: utilizing the command line (bash scripting) and data analysis with Python.

Home Town Outreach
======
Having the opportunity to go back to my home town each year and talk with the high school physics class has been extremely special to me. When I was in their shoes, I didn't know that pursuing a career in research was a possibility and, as someone that (marginally) excelled in STEM subjects, I assumed that the best career choice for me was a degree in engineering. I quickly realized that physics was my true passion and even found out that I could make a career out of it! I have really enjoyed being able to talk with the students about STEM research, what it entails, and my personal experience as someone with at least somewhat of a shared experience with them.
