Syracuse University Research in Physics (SURPh) Program
======
For the last two summers I have been a mentor for a total of four Syracuse City School District high school students that participated in the SURPh program hosted by professors in the department of physics. Each summer two students worked together on a project studying the tidal disruption of stars by suppermassive black holes. I worked with the students on understanding the properties and evolution of stars using the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) stellar evolution software and Mathematica for data analysis. The students then studied the rate at which stellar debris returned to the black hole once the star was tidally destroyed using a combination of analytical and computational (smoothed-particle hydrodynamics) methods. The work of the past two summers recently culminated in a research paper submitted to the Astrophysical Journal Letters with ALL FOUR SURPh STUDENTS! You can access the pre-print version of this paper [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.11496.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

Home Town Outreach
------
I recently returned to my home town to give a talk to the high school physics class about STEM research and my experience as a physicist. This was a really great experience and I intend to continue into the future.
